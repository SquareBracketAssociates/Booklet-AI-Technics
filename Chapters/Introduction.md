## IntroductionYou are reading the draft of a forthcoming book. It will take us some years to get to what we want.This book is supported by Arolla [http://www.arolla.fr](http://www.arolla.fr) and Inria.We want to thank O. Moglia for his constant support. Do not hesitate to give us feedback and suggestions.O. Zaitsev and S. Ducasse### How this book is structured?To give you a hands-on introduction to every algorithm and guide you through the entire process of its implementation, we have adopted the following structure for each chapter that reflects the good practices of test-driven development:1. **Definition** - theoretical background and mathematical definition of each algorithm.1. **Desired API** - based on the definition, we design an API that we would like our implementation to have.1. **Writing tests** - we start by writing tests for the API that we have defined in the previous section. At this point all tests should be failing.1. **Implementation** - here we describe the implementation that would make our tests pass, one test at a time.1. **Examples** - finally, we demonstrate several applications of the algorithm and show how it can be used to solve the real-life problems.
